### Comprehensive Plan for Enhancements

1. **Review Current Functionality**: 
   - The application currently fetches weather and pollution data based on user input for a city and displays it on the index page.

2. **Identify Potential Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding features such as error handling for invalid city names, displaying loading indicators while fetching data, or enhancing the user interface.

3. **Dependent Files**:
   - The main file to be edited is `app.py`, as it contains the core logic for fetching and displaying data.
   - The `index.html` template may also need updates to accommodate any new features or changes in data presentation.

4. **Follow-up Steps**:
   - Implement the identified enhancements.
   - Test the application to ensure all features work as expected.
   - Gather user feedback for further improvements.
